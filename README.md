## Description

The Quiz App is a responsive and progressive (installable) web application built with React.js for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end. The app allows users to take a quiz where they are presented with a series of questions and are required to select the correct answer. After completing the quiz, the app displays the user's score and rank based on their performance.
